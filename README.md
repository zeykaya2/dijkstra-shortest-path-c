# Dijkstra's Algorithm in C

This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm in C to find the shortest path in a graph represented by an adjacency matrix.

## Features
- Adjacency matrix based graph representation
- Calculates shortest paths from a source node to all others
- Shows path and distance for each node

## How to Run

```bash
gcc dijkstra.c -o dijkstra
./dijkstra
